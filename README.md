# Redacted

Redacted is an iOS chat client designed to hide chat messages sent on it from all third parties as well as prevent the messages from being read after a certain period of time. This is made possible through the Tor network and strong cryptography. Once the iOS version is complete, other operating systems may be considered.

## Acknowledgements

This project uses a myriad of third party, open source libraries to function. A full list of acknowledgements and licenses and stuff can be found in [LEGAL][*]. I would like to especially acknowledge Mike Tigas' [Onion Browser](https://github.com/mtigas/iOS-OnionBrowser) for providing code to run Tor on iOS. While this project was originally forked from the Onion Browser project, all but the code running Tor has been phased out.

  [*]: Eventually. It still needs to be written ;) As of right now, the LICENSE file from Onion Browser has been retained which contains semi-accurate information about the current state of the project.
